### Template Generator for Figma

A lightweight, designer-friendly plugin that eliminates the tedious setup of new Figma projects. Create beautifully organized file structures with pre-configured pages for every stage of your design process.

**Why Template Generator?**

Starting a new project shouldn't mean manually creating the same pages over and over. Template Generator gives you a clean, customizable foundation so you can jump straight into designing.

**Key Features:**

- **Instant Project Setup**: Generate a complete page structure with one click
- **Fully Customizable**: Drag to reorder pages, toggle sections on/off, rename anything
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-configured with industry-standard pages (Moodboards, Explorations, Final Design, etc.)
- **Section Dividers**: Organize your file with visual separators between project phases
- **Smooth Interactions**: Polished drag-and-drop with live reordering and smooth animations
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes during late-night design sessions
- **Clean Interface**: Minimal, distraction-free UI inspired by modern design tools

**Perfect For:**

- Design systems and component libraries
- Client project kickoffs
- Design handoffs and documentation
- Team collaboration and file organization
- Anyone tired of manual file setup

**How It Works:**

1. Open the plugin in any Figma file
2. Customize your page list (add, remove, reorder, rename)
3. Toggle off any pages you don't need
4. Click "Create Pages" and you're ready to design

The plugin comes with sensible defaults including pages for documentation, moodboards, explorations, presentations, and final designs—but everything is customizable to match your workflow.
